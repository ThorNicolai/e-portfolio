# e-portfolio ~ Thor Nicola√Ø

The website can be found [here](http://users.hogent.be/~533471tn/eportfolio/) and was made with HTML & CSS using Bootstrap (front-end framework).

This was a interesting experience for me because I wasn't the best webdesigner before I started this project, I managed to adopt very fast to the bootstrap framework and now I'm highly capable of using it.
